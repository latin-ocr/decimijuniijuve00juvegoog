bably the commentator on Virgil). It may be well to exhibit

some specimens ol this “latentia'' taken chiefly, though ‘not
exclusively, from the old corrector of Pithou's MS, who
wished to bring his copy into respectable consonuity to the
common type. In this endeavour he sometimes effaced the
original reading entirely, sometimes he left it legible besides
his own correction, so that it might perhaps be possible to
ascertain, if the MS. were now aecessible, whether it was cor-r
rected by two different hands, or whether the difference in
the style ol the corrections is due to the lact that the sam'e
owner went through the MS. twice, possibly with different
authorities. · .

In 111. 13, P. had meldanus from a reminiscence of
Virgil, who is fond of praesens in this sense, Ec. 1. 42, Georg.

gotten the hicat v. 16, and wished to substitute “hic'' At
v. 29, P. and the Scholia give Artorius, most other MSS. read
Arsanus, and several have Arlnri to match at v. 212, which'
certainly looks like patching ; on the other hand, P. and the
Scholia have mnniapalrs at v. 34, which the corrector and the
interpolated MSS. give correctly. Two lines further on, the¹
corrector deliberately gives the difficult reading vulgus quem
lubet (unless he intended to write vulga), while P. had the easy
reading angens quum siebat, and other MSS. endeavour to meet
the difficulty by reading vulgi. Again at v. 218, the corrector·
alters the easy reading Haec Asianorum, which is found in
P. and the Scholia, into the difficult ficasranornm, which the
other MSS. give with triding variations, so that it seems that
here at least P.'s archetype deliberately altered the text to

remove a difficulty.
In xr. 38, P. had most probably culina, like two other

MSS, while the corrector and the majority of MSS. read
crumina or crumena. At xr. 91, P. has postremo, the majority·
have a false and obvious correction, ragidique. v. 128, P. has
