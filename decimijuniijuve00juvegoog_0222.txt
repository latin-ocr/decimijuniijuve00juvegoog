’ . SATIRA XV,

'Impulit hos? quae tanta sames infestaque vallo
Anna coegerunt tam detestabile monstrum
Audere? Anne aliam, terra Memphitide sicca,
Invidiam 'facerent nolenti surgere Nilo?

Qua nec terribiles Cimbri, nec Britones unquam,
Sauromataeque truces aut immanes Agathyrsi,
Hac saevit rabie imbelle et inutile vulgus,
Parvula fictilibus solitum dare vela phaselis,

Et brevibus pictae remis incumbere testae.

Nec poenam sceleri invenies, nec digna parabis .
