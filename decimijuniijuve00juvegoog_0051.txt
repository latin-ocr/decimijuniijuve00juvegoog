xliv INTRODUCTION.

In the Eighth, most MSS.‚ but not the best, omit v. 7 (sec
nord: v. 78 might be omitted as a question of taste, on the
same principle as all editors omit Gutta cavat lapidem, con-
sumitur anulus usu, which occurs in the Dresden MS. aster
xnr. 18: vv. 111, 112, are in all the MSS. ; but they are so flat
that Jahn and Mauso wish to leave them out altogether, while
Heinrich and Heinecke more plausibly treat unicus as a gloss
on unus, and go straight on to Despicias tu. Jahn and Lach-
mann condemn v. 1243 Ruperti, v. 194, and is followedby
Heinrich in his condemnation os v. 202.

In the Tenth, Ruperti condemns v. 37, Pinzger v. 148 3
Heinrich condemns v. 189, but not v. 187.

In the Eleveuth at v. 30, Heinecke wishes to read vel sacri
in porte senatus Esse velia-seu tu magno discrimine causam
Protegcre affictas, unc, striking out two lines, which are a
tasteless display of cbeap reading. Heinrich condemns vv. ⁶3
and 99, in which last he is followed by Jahn ε v. 108 is omitted
by Heinrich and several MSS.‚ and condemned by Jahn: vv.
165, 166, are also omitted by several MSS.‚ and condemned,
perhaps justly, by Heinrich, Pinzger and Jahn: as the Scholium
in several MSS.‚ which gives them, “Hi duo versus etin aliis
reperti sunt,” makes it not improbable that ffley are a marginal
quotation, which different copyists foisted into the text at '
different places. Heinrich condemns v. 182, but not v. 208.

In the Twelfth v. 36'1s condemned by Heinrich, vv. 51, 52,
by Bentley, Pinzger, Heinrich, Jahn

In the Thirteenth Heinrich rs alone 1n condemning v 166.

In the Fourteenth v. 229 interrupts the grammatical se·
quence‚ is omitted m six MSS.‚ and condemned by Ruperti,
Heinrich, Jahn ; but it seems more likely that Juvenal leit it,
than that an interpolator introduced it.

In the Fisteenffl, Ruperti condemns v. 34. Francke, who
wants to show that he wishes disinterestedly to purify Juvenal’s
text as well as to prove that he was never in Egypt, omits from
summus utrimque in v. 35, to sedin v. 38, as well as the
longer passage from horrida sanein v. 44, to titubantibus· in
