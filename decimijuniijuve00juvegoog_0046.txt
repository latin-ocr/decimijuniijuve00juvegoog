INTRODUCTION. xxxix

pretension of Horace to be throughout a polished plagiarist
The habit of personal lampoons seems to have been common
to both Greeks and Romans. It is possible, that in the

original comic choms, which resumed its native freedom in ·

the parabasis‚ individuals had the opportunity of distinguishing
themselves by telling impromptus 3 while it is certain that the
Romans retained to alate period the capacity of j0ining ex-
. tempore in a metrical expression of humorous contempt. But
among the Greeks, the element of the choms, which was
capable of musical and poetical ornament, was the one selected
for cultivation 3 the time carne when the moody and unsocial
Roman, in the solitude which sncceeded the festival, worked.

But even if we still possessed all the lost works of Ennius,
Lucilius, and Varro, it is possible that we should hardly feel
sate in forming a very definite theory of the origin of Roman
satire. It would be difficult to be positive aboutthe beginnings
of our own literature, unless we were able to ascend above
Chaucer and Gower. We are on firmer ground when we
endeavour to trace the development of Roman satire between
Horace and his two successors. It is a proof of the growing

unreality, the mechanical sequacity of post-Augustan poetry, ’

that both Persius and Juvenal follow Horace in affecting alarrn
at the consequences of their own freedom. The secluded life
of Persius makes the affectation peculiarlyoffensive in his case;
but both he and Juvenal are equally faulty in forgettiug that
Horace did not deprecate hostility till he had done something
to deserve it ; and reserved his hesitations and apologies for
the introduction of his Second Book, which shows signs of
serious precaution in the care with which the poet contrives
