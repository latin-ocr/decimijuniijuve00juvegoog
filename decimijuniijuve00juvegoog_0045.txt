little in the intervals of writing. The same might perhaps
be said oi Aristophanes, but there is a tone ol hilarity and
animal spin‘ts about the old Attic Comedy, which springs
from the contagion ot' a crowd and the merriment of a holiday,
while in Roman Satire, where this element of gaiety is missing,
the author is always in danger os lapsing into stiff morality, or
crabbed invective, and never succeeds ‘sor long in maintaining
himself in the genial position of Aristophaneo, who, though
often coarse, and almost always narrow, has the great gin of
sitting loose to his own beliefs. He is never reduced, like
Juvenal, to such sorry devices, in order to raise a laugh, as
appeals under protest to a mythology which he and his audience
disbelieve5 for he possesses a far more piquant resource in the
outrageous parodies which he executes on a mythology which
he is sincerely resolved to defend. In a parabasis os Aristo-
phanes, we feel the meniment of the citizen, as well as the
anxiety and ambition of the author3 in a Satire of Juvenal,
disappointed ambition isthe only visible motive of a poet who
wishes us to laugh, because he is long past laughing.

Itis to the credit of Juvenal that he should have preferred
to consider himself as the successor os L‘ucilius, rather than as
the latest imitator os the Old Attic comedy. It is character-

plead guilty to the charge. of having horrowed nothing from
Greece, should have chosen to represent themselves as con-
tinuators ofAristophanes. It is characteristic os Roman society
that the saturo of Ennius should have given way to the satura
of Lucilius. The former seems really to have been analogous
to the old comedy3 we cannot doubt that in the hands of

Ennius it tended to become a reproduction oi Greek models,
nor can we doubt that Lucilius, though he was a literary
innovator, and introduced a kind of poem for which there
was no Greek precedent, inspired himself as much as possible
from Greek sources. In this way it is possible to account at
once sor the well-known judgment of Quinctilian, that, in Satire
at any rate, Roman literature was independent, and for the
