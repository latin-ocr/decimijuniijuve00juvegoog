survived' its cause. Some* old copyists seem to have felt

a'tlraraedo principe as a difficulty aster Nero’s death; hence ’

the gloss natucwhieh has replaced mimus in most MSS. It
remains to explain the allusion to Lateranus, asos age to

, defend Nero, and the address to Rubellius Plautus or Blandus.
· In the first place, we may observe that the general and shame·
less relaxatiou of manners suits better with the ageos Nero,
than with that os Domitian, the reviver of the censorship; in
the second place, lateranus must obviously be a contemporary
os N ero; in the third place, it is exceedingly improbable that
the younger Blandus (if there ever was one) could be the child
of an imperial mother 3 because it Plautus, like his father, had
married into the impen'al family, Tacitus would have mentioned
it as an additional reason sor the jealousy os Nero ; and it is
not likely that Juvenal would have consounded Plautus with
his son. It would be less violent to suppose that Juvenal
wrote Planta under Nero, having taken offence at the seclusion,
which Tacitus and his class admired, and afterwards, when
preparing his satires for publication, decided on' altering an·
obsolete apostrophe, but forgot to change the circumstances
when he altered the name. Il this hypothesis seems com-
plicated‚ it must be remembered that all the MSS. have Blande
or Plance, while Plauti rests only on the high authority o't'
Lipsius 3 that the hero of the second Dunciad, in addition to
his own sins, has to endure much inappropriate invective due
to the peculiar dulness of the hero of the first; and that what-
was possible to Pope in an elaborate work, was not impossible·
to Juvenal in a passing digression. ‘
One piece oi evidence still remains sor notice—the allusions
in Martial to a Juvenal with whom he lived on terms oi
affectionate familiarity at Rome, when he published his Seventh
Book (where the twenty-fourth epigram is addressed to Juvenal,
and the ninety·first alludes to him), and who was still pre-
sumably at Rome as a restless suitor for preferment in the
beginning os Trajan's reign, while Martial, having given up·
¹ the struggle, was enjoying the repose os· his native Bilbilis·-
