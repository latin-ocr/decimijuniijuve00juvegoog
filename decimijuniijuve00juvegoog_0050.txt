INTRODUCTION. xliii

densed and fastidious author like Persius; in a writer so
vigorous and yet so prolix as Juvenal, it is possible to defend
most of them as at worst pardonable redundancies, it would
be easy to defend all ol thern as belonging to altemative
dralts of the passages in which they occur, between which
the writer never decided.

Most of them make perfectly good sense where they stand,
and aresupported by all the ancient authorities. Others are
omitted by several MSS., and one or two interrupt the con-
nexion wherever they can be placed The first fact proves at
most that they displeased ancient critics as well as modem3
me second would be decisive if there were not reason to
believe that Juvenal never finished the revision os his satires. Ι

Tm introductory satire is naturally polished with most care,
and there only one critic has been found to suspect one line
(v. 157), which is so difficult that his suspicion is likely to be
more popular than it deserves.

In the Third Satine Jahn condemns v. 104 ¹, against the
MSS. and John of Salisbury; Heinrich and Pinzger condemn
v. ¹13 asan unnecessary explanation ; lor the same reason, is
the MSS. were few or worthless, vv. 49, 50, might be elimi-
nated; Heinecke condemns v. 281.

, In the Fourth Satire nobody condemns any thing.

In the Fifth, Heinrich rejects the end of v. 9, and the
beginning of v. 10, and the whole of v. 66. Pinzger had
anticipated his dislike of v. 513 but the latter critic defends
v. 91, though omitted by Pithou’s MS. and condemned by
Weber, Heinrich, Jahn—who also condemns v. 140, I suppose

for reasons of taste which would justify Heinecke’s rejection ol
vv. 146—148.

In the Seventh, Jahn, Pinzger, and Heinrich condemn
v. 15, which contains an unusual quantity 3 Jahn alters v. 50
to suit his rejection os v. 51 ; Heinrich condemns vv. 138 and
1813 Valla condemned vv. 240, 241.

’¹ Whenever nothing is said to the contrary, ὼε MSS. are unanimous in
favour os me verse attached.
