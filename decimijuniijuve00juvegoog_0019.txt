the mention of his Agave proves that the Parisoi the com-

pleted satire must be Domitian’s favourite In spite of this,

however, most editors waver between Trajan and Hadrian,

inclining to the former, though it would be much more reason- ι
able to treat Trajan‘s reign than Domitian’s as a period os

literary decline. The Scholiast, who did not share their zeal

for the purity and independenee ol 'Juvenal’s literary con-

science, says, with nalve absurdity, “Neronem palpat.”

Itis chiefly in the First and Eighth Satires that we find
plausible grounds for suspecting allusions to the reign os
Nero, which have sumished such a plentiful harvest of con-
jectures to'annotators, from the Scholiast downwards. Madvig
(in his Opuscula Academica, r. 29-63, 11.167—2o5) has
effectually refuted the excesses of this tradition; but he has
not condescended to examine whether it is wholly destitute of

· foundation.

Or course, every one would admit that a note like this on
1. 59, “Qui bona. praa: praiter equos leoc dicit et Neronem
tangit,” is a mere conjecture, neither very acute, nor very
probable; but notes like those on r. 33-'3 5, seem to embody
ina blundering way a real ancient tradition. The reader
shall judge':-“ Delator amici. Heliodorum signnicm delatorem
