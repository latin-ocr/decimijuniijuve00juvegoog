26 D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Phaecasianorum vetera ornamenta deorum,
Hic libros dabit et forulos mediamque Minervam,

Hic modium argenti: meliora et plura reponit

Persicus, orborum lautissimus et merito jam

Suspectus tanquam ipse suas incenderit aedeS.
Si potes avelli Circensibus optima Sorae
Aut Fabrateriae domus aut Frusinone paratur,

Quanti nunc tenebras unum conducis in annum.

2²5

Hortalus hic'puteusque brevis nec reste movendus
In tenues plantas sacili diffunditur haustu.
Vive bidentis amans et culti villicus horti,

Unde epulum possis centum dare Pythagoreis,

Est aliquid, quocumque loco, quocumque recessu,

Unius sese dominum secisse lacertae.
Plurimus hic aeger moritur vigilando: sed ipsum

218] ‘phaecasianorumt is the
reading of most MSS. ‘Haec Asia·
norum,' which looks like a correc-
'tion oi the text, is found iu P. and
the Scholiast. If it is right, the
women join the collection as well as
the mourning; but their solitary re·
presentative looks sorlom among so
many men. Hence Jahn reads hic,
which would be quite unobjection-
able, il Juvenal had written it ; 'and
others try to make hacc neuter.
lt is very difficult to guess what
gods could be characterized hythe
white woollen shoes os Athenian or
Alexandrine priests; but “potior
est lectio difficillima.”

219] As other friends, 216—218,
have fumished the gymnasium, this
one iumishes the library.

22ο modium argenti] About two
gallons os small change worth eight
hundredor a thousand pounds. Cf.
Hor. S. 1. i. 96, dives Ut metiretur
nummos. Alter Confluat impensas
(sup. 216), symmetry requires a con·

tribution iu money in addition to

those iu kind.
221 orborum lautissimus] So

that he lives in better style than any
other orbus.

222 suspectus, tanquam aa]
This use of tanquam, which is sre-
quent in the Silver Age, does not
imply the injustice of the suspicion,
accusation, dcc, aa a clause with
tanquam may either state the reason
os an unjust charge or the nature oi
a'ust.

J224 amem] “Is bought” Con·
trast i. 105, 106:

“ Quinque tabernae
Quadringenta parant.'’

225 tenebras] A dark smoky

rret. ⁵
ga226—229] “Every thing is on a
diminutive scale—the garden, the
young planta, that want all the water
they get from the shallow well, that
needs uo rope to the *bucket3 still,
if you stick to it you can get adinner
out of it that would be an event to
ahundred Pythagoreans.” The water
is drawn with a swipe instead of a
windlass; as it is turned out of the
bucket it runs down along the little
trenches between the little beds.
