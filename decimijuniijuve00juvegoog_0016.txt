INTRODUCTION. “ ior

tial published his Fourth Book, comparatively early under
Domitian.- ⁷ ’ ’ ’

, In xu. 80, there is an allusion to the inner'basin of the
Portus Argustr', which was not completed, according to the
Scholia, till Trajan, though the general construction of the
harbour was due to Claudius, and the Scholiast may have
confused the harbour at Centum Cellae, now Civita Vecchia,
· with that at Portus. ’

Moreover, as the information about Trajan is introduced to

give an erroneous sense to rursum, we are scarcely bound to
believe that the interram-tuti stagna sinus had been enclosed
as a separate basin when Juvenal wrote.
ψ In viru 51, there is an ambiguous passage, that would suit
the latter partos Trajan’s reign, or the early part of Vespasian’s, ἵ
almost equally well or* ill The reference to the eagles, which
control the conquered Batavian, would 'be most in place im
mediately after the revolt of Civilis. On the other hand,
Vespasian never sent an expedition to the Euphrates3 and it
would be'an unpleasant inaccuracy to couple the achieve-
ments of Cerealis and Corbulo: unless, indeed, Juvenal may
mean to refer to the danger of the eastern frondet, in the
troubles after Nero's death. On the whole, the earlier date
seems best 3 as to mention nothing further than the Euphrates
would have been a very poor eompliment to Trajan, is his
reign was intended. ’ ¹

In xm. 27, there is ayet more ambiguous appeal to the age
of a friend, who was sixty years old when Juvenal wrote, and
was born when Fonteius was consul 'lbis excites our hopes
of being able to fix the date of at least one whole satire 3 but
‚unfortunately one Fonteius was consul nn. 12, another ab. ·
59, yet another ab. 67. Lipsius and Professor Ramsay prefer
the earliest date, most other authorities adopt the second.

Inxv. 27, we have to choose in the same way between
one Junius, who was consul no. 84 ς another, who was consul
no.11'9;anda Juncus whose other names may 'have been
Sextus Julius, who was consul on the ides 'of October no.
