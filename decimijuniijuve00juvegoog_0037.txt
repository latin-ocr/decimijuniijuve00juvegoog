esteem. Cotta' seems to have been honestly in favour os a strict
and severe system of administration3 but only a system os coo
sistent tolerance and mutual support could have enabled the
senate to hold its own against Tiberius—and Cotta is con-
demned accordingly. Juvenal does not differ lrom Tacitus in
his judgment on the rank and file os the delatores, who owed
their influence exclusively to their activity in providing the
govemment with victims. Their activity in reality pressed quite
as severely on the bourgeoisie as on the aristocracy. Not im-
probably the govemment of a Domitian shed less blood forits
own protection in all the Roman empire than many of the
mediaeval tyrannies of Italy, and those not the worst, shed ina
single year. A large and active class os informers was hardly
required to provide for all the executions that we have reason
to suspect But the exchequer which had to provide so many
largesses for spendthrift nobles, sor men of letters en deipom'-

it. The rights of the fiscus were as extensive and undelined

might almost be said that the means for enforcing them were as
inadequate. A single adiuratus fisci here and there who might
be seduced or intimidated was not enough to enforce the multi-
plicity of claims which the inventive ingenuity of the crown
lawyers had revived or established a probri. The result was
that even in the fourth century there were great numbers ot'
respectable people in the habitual enjoyment os what might
be plausibly represented as due to the emperor. These were
imperfectly reassured when a well-intentioned sovereign decreed
that the informers should be punished if they prosecuted with- Ι
out the sanction of the advocatus fisci, though of course it was
possible for private persons to ascertain the instructions and to
calculate the action of a known and responsible official. Under
Domitian and other emperors who, asDomitian himself observed,
encouraged inforrners by neglecting to discourage them, it was
impossible for a senator to feel that his property was his own, it
