somewhat prosaic duties relieved at rare intervals by somewhat
dull festivity. Yet Plautus succeeds in being thoroughly genial:
he laughs without a touch ol Juvenal's ferocity at the lollies ol
the world: at bottom he regards enjoyment as synonymous
with profligacy, but though his standard ol profligacy is hardly ·
reasonable he regards profligacy with tolerance asa solly not as
a crime. Even in Juvenal the relish for innocent pleasutes
was not wholly extinct ; we can trace its remains in the casual
wish that the fountain ol Egeria had been left in its primaeval
simplicity, in the invitation to Persius to come toan early
dinner at twelve and hear Homer and Virgil-a form of dissi·
patiou, in Juvenal’s judgment, too exciting to be indulged in
often Perhaps the clearest trace of all isthe pretty and sympa-
thetic description of the slave-boy who does not like being
taken away from his kids to wait at table. Still it may be¹
said that the honest man, who is the ideal of most satirists,
is seldom so unattract‘ive as he appears in Juvenal. His⁸
austerity indeed is so impracticable as to betray him into
unreality. Isin order to'be virtuous it is necessary to be dull
with the dulness of three centuries ago, it becomes necessary,
in order to make existence endurable, that excesses should be
permitted‚ not to say encouraged3 in the young. For instance,
in the Eighth satire, where the tone is intended to be losty,
alter the indictment against Lateranus is complete, an advocate
is introduced to plead in extenuation, that everybody does the
same when young3 whereto Juvenal only ventures to reply‚
that Lateranus is old enough to know better. In the Eleventh
Satira, where the tone is intended to be genial‚ he says it is
quite proper for young men to take their mistresses to the
circus in their finery, and talk loud, and bet high3 for himself
he prefers to sun himself in a comer where he can get rid of his
toga. His ideal was hardly one to inspire the sustained enthu-
siasm or the tranquil assurance which would have guaranteed
the consistency of his moral tone. As it is we lind him at one
moment lashing himself into a tempest of indignation thata
'nobleman should actually put the drag on his own carriage
