v. 48. The last omission is approved by G. Hermann, and os
course by Heinrich. Francke also condemns vv. 97, 98, which
, are too bad sor any interpolator who knew, what Juvenal did
not when he wrote them, what was coming next Orelli and
Francke show their taste by omitting from Elementa in v. 86 to
reor in v. 87, and from mc enim in v. 107 to putant in v. 108,
respectively.

In the Sixteenth Satire, nobody condemns any thing, though
some condemn every thing. It is fortunate that these ques
tions may be answered one way or another without affecting
our judgement os Juvenal’s meaning, without materially affect-
ing our judgement of his literary sorm; sor, as we have seen,
they must be answered, if at all, with little help from external
evidence.

The principal manuscript authority for the text of Juvenal
is at present inaccessible‚ and our knowledge of it depends
chiefly on Pithou's collation in the sixteenth century, when
it was at Buda; it is now said to be at Monte Pessulo. It
is very carelessly written, as are the ancient Scholia, which
seem to rank next in the confidence of the best editors.
Here are a few readings from Pithou’s MS, which I have
sometimes cited in the notes as P, taken from the First
Satire alone :-

v. 35. Quem Massa lim etque munere pultat, for Quem
Massa timet, quem muncrcpahtat.

v. 38. montib. . with two letters erased, sor noctibus.

v. 53. A ucho medeas, sor A ut Diomedeas.

v. 85. totum ira voluptas, for votum timor ira voluptas.

, ν. 102. Prior inquit et ego adsum sor Prior inquit ego
adsum. ’

- v. 106. Purpmas for pugnum, to the destruction of the
mette. ,

- The Scholia have the look of being copied from notes care·
*lessly made from dictation, sor where Juvenal’s words are
given they are frequently spelt phonetically, so as to repre·
sen‘t a later pronunciation. ’
