*ing and'acting as if they were living under a provisional govem-
ment. There were men who made a trade of detecting and
denouncing disaffection 3 sometimes, though very rarely, they
descended to the arts of the modern informer: those who
were independent of the trade did not always disdain to
take advantage of the imprudence of a personal enemy to
revenge a private grudge‚ by denouncing their antagonist on
any charge that would bring his fate to be determined by a
sovereign, who was always under the temptation to strengthen
his position by terrorising the aristocracy. Undoubtedly Taci-

administration will have to wink at profligacy, and that no
administratiou‚ which is not strong enough to tolerate any
amount of disaffection which stops short at overt acts, can ever

on individuals like Messalinus Cotta, Seneca, Piso, and Vibius
Crispus. They were all bountiful or at least goodnatnred,
therefore Juvenal respected them 3 they were all potentes,
therefore Tacitus distrusted them. Seneca escapes best 3 it
was ungracious to attack the memory of a victim of Nem,
but all Tacitus' praise is for the genius, not for the virtue,
of the philosophe13 he writes upon principles which pre-
clude the question how far such intense and genuine ethical
fervour could atone for political compliances. Piso was guilty
of a desire to reign, and Tacitus will not decide whether he
owed his reputation to his virtues or to vices which produced
the same effects. Vibius Crispus he seems to admit was geue-
rally respected as an able and distinguished man, though the
historiam belonged to a set of purists who refused him their
