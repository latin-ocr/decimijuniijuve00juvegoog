he* ielt 'that the dignity os the order and the security os it's ,
individual members was the end, and the prosperity os the
empire the means. Aster all there is little reason sor surprise·
that the antagonisms which produced the empire should have
lived on under ir. The power oi the emperors rested upon·
opinion no less than upon sorce3 or rather, the convictions
and interests of th'emilitary so'rce of the State made it necessary
that there should be an emperor. Among other causes, publio
opinion had considerable influence in deciding who the em*
petor should be; it had certainly a paramount influence in
deciding how long any particular emperor should reign. Con·
spiracies always began in the camp or the palace against an
emperor whom opinion had condemned 3 and it is characteristic
ol the difference between ancient and modern society, we may
add, between Roman and Byzantine society, that when an
emperor had once> become a mark for conspiracies, one con·
spiracy or other was sure to succeed at last. The first Caesar
certainly gave unnecessary offence to the prejudices os the
nobility. Octavian, Claudius, and Vespasian, though deserential
in extermis, kept the balance substantially even. Tiberius
and Domitian, while they, decimated the aristocracy, leant
steadily in the direction of privilege ; the despotism ol Caius
was demagogic that it might be levelling; the despotism of
Nero was levelling that it might be demagogic. It is a proof
of the intensity of the storms which agitated the last century
of the republic, that their aiter gusts could sway the course os
the empire. Upon the whole, vthe nobility had weathered the
gale ; from the time oi Gaius Gracchus to the time of Publius
Clodius and Gaius Curio, there had been a constant struggle,
not only to introduce new principles of govemment, but to
raise a new class to power to carry out those principles. The
principles triumphed with the first Caesar 3 all the Caesars con-

, tinued to watch over their development witha solicitude, seldom «
ἶ· unintelligent, and scarcely ever relaxed. But the second
ἶ Caesar had decided that the triumph os the principles of the

¹democracy should be as little ol a triumph as possible for the
s. J. . c
