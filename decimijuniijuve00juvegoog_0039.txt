th'at he attacked little which was really valuable, or as hir
misfortune that his time presented nothing valuable to ⁸be
attacked3 it is certain that no satirist had fewer such attacks to
answer for. Lucian and Voltaire did their best to propagate
what serious thinkers of every school might combine to stig·
matise as infidelity. Aristophanes contributed directly to the
condemnation of Socrates 3 in the latter part of his career his
protest against sophistical refinements subsided into an excuse
for selfcomplacent brutality. Moliere devoted one of his best
comedies to the sanctity of passing conventionalities; another
to the indelibility of social distinctions3 another to the utter
ineptitude of female culture. Juvenal to be sure does object
to a woman ham'ng an opinion on the comparative merits of
Homer and Virgil, but he objects not because her opinion
is certain to be ridiculous, but because she is certain to annoy
her husband with it And he is more consistent as wellas more
moderate than Moliere: he pines for the good old times before
the importation of hexameters: he regrets the obsolete life of the
Sabine farmer, when the men of the family worked all day in the
fields, and came home to a huge bowl of porn'dge, while the
women kept their hands coarse and their hearts clean by spin-
ning‘3 and every body was convincar, without quite knowing
what purple was, that it was something wicked and outlandish

It is curious that the universal empire of Rome should
have failed so completely to produce anything like a cosmopo
litan culture. As long as Rome remained the capital both the
emperors and the aristocracy continued to oscillate between
aprovincial affectation of native simplicity and a childish osten-
tation of foreign graces. Nero’s passion for personal display
had carried him far beyond Greek precedent, and such prece-
dents as he had dated from the days when Greek civilisation
was still shut up within the narrow limits of civic life, which
might excuse a mansor showing off his accomplishments' to
his neighbours‚ before Philip had reproached Alexander for
playing the lyre too well for a king. Even aster that time
young men of good position still acted in the Atellan farces
