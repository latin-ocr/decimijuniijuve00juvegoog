dius had studied quo firmior adversus fortuita rempublicam
capesseret (Hist. 1v. 5). But it is certain from more than one
passage that he had succeeded in arranging his own lise without
the support of convictions though not without the stimulus of
ideas. Ἀε these ideas were mostly borrowed from the Porch,
it would be possible for a careless reader to class him among
the disciples of Zeno. It would be hard to make the same
mistake about juvenal: there is indeed one satire, the fifteenth,
where he appeals to Stoicism with as much respect as a satirist
can appeal to any authority 3 there are otherS, like the fourth
ἲ aud tenth, where he uses Stoical ideas without anything ap
proaehing to a disclaimer of the authority of the reigning phi
losophy: though even in the tenth the distinction between true
aud false goods‚ upon which the whole satire turns, is really
Socratic rather than Stoical: in fact the distinction between real
and apparent prosperity vauishes as soon as it has been laid
down that everything external is ideally indifferent. Moreover‚
there are passages like 111. 116sq.‚ xur. rrosq.,where the writer
shows an unmistalreable animus against Stoicism, or at least

against Stoics. One cannot tell how far he may have been ⁴
disgusted by the inconsistencies of individuals, and there is no

doubt that such scandals were very grues, and far from rare;
but, in lact, their pretensions were¹ intolerable to all hut those
who felt that they too were philosophers; their demands upon
human nature were too severe for any man to accept honestly
who was not heartily in eamest about his own character, a
subject which seldom interests a satirist.

Another point in which Juvenal and Tacitus in the main ’
coincide is their indignation against the delatores ,· a pest which
has had its analogues under every tyranny. At Rome it
assumed a peculiar form owing to several circumstances, of
which the most important were the hypocrisy of the Caesars in
retaining the forms of a republic and the absence of any system
os state police. The tyranny of a bad emperor was irresistibley
but it was sar from being omnipresent: the govemment of the

Ι senate and the equestrian order had proved itself inadequate to
