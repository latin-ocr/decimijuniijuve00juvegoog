with his own hands ; at another, recouuting the deepest moral
degradation as coolly as an election commissioner, who enjoys
the exposure of a corruption which he honestly intends to sup
presa In the Ninth Satire particularly the tone of bantering
ironyis almost as disgusting as the subject ; the Sixth is less
offensive‚ but the writer is obviously determined to extract the
maximum of amusement from the painful subject of marriage,
which he regards from the old Roman point of view as a neces ,
sary evil or rather a disagreeable duty, which it is Quixotic to
undertake to perform for the public benefit, and childish to
assume with any hope of personal satisfaction Accordingly he
proceeds with a little passion, a great deal of verve supported
by a great deal of gusto, to catalogue all the grievances of
husbands, who are never secure against being taken to task
for solecisms when alive, or against having their children mur·

writers who put a witty denunciation of loose men into the
mouth of a loose woman.

Both Persius aud Horace are really more cheerful as
wellas more sincere. Their satire is not a protest against the
hardships of life, it is not the organ of the grievances of a dis-
contented class ; the world would suit them well enough if it
could only become a little more reasonable for its own benefit,
not for theirs. Horace perhaps found its folly such good fun
that he had hardly charity enough to wish it wiser, and Persius¹
was too good a Stoic to be annoyed by the general unwisdom
except so far as it presented a temptation to himself So far as
they have a serious purpose (aud Persius is very serious) they
preach where Juvenal denounces. It was impossible for them
to stop short, like Juvenal, with a catalogue of vicious habits to
be abandoned, of virtuous practices to be renewed3 their con-
ception of virtue, without being precisely higher than his, was
at any rate more inward and more free. They did little per-
haps to raise the conception of character, but they succeeded;
