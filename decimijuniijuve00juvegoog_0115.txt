’58 D. JUNJI JUVENALIS
Afficit ille animos tantaque libidine vulgi
Auditur: sod, quum fregit subsellia versu,
Esurit, intactam Paridi nisi vendat Agaven,
Ille et militiae multis largitur honorem,

A Semestri vatum digitos circumligat auro.
Quod non dant proceres, dabit histrio: tu Camerinos 90
Et Bareas, tu nobilium magna atria curas?
Praefectos Pelopea facit, Philomela tribunos.
Haud tamen invideas vati, quem pulpita pascunt.
Quis tibi Maecenas?·quis nunc erit aut Proculeius
Aut Fabius? quis Cotta iterum? quis Lentulus alter? 95
Tunc par ingenio pretium ; tunc utile multis
Pallere et vinum toto nescire Decembri.
Vester porro labor secundior, historiarum
Scriptores? petit hic plus temporis atque 'olei plus:
Namque oblita modi millesima pagina surgit ' 100
Omnibus et multa crescit damnosa papyro.

Sic ingens rerum numerus jubet atque operum lex.
Quae tamen inde seges? terrae quis fructus apertae?
Quis dabit historico, quantum daret acta legenti?
