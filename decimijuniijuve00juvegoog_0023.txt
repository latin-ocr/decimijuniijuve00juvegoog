xvi INTRODUCTION;

(Mart xtr. 18.1). As none ‘of these epigrams contain' any

allusion toour Juvenal’s career as a satirist, as* the gentlemanly
mendicancy implied in· the latest epigram ¹is incompatible
with the statement of the biographers that he could go on
with the study of declamation for amusement till middle life,

' and with his own allusions to a modest competence, and as
Juvenal himself says nothing of Martial, 1 am inclined to
believe that there were two Juvenals wholived at Rome. iu
the time of Martial.

On the whole, therefore, it is not impossible that Juvenal
was born about 20 or 3on.1>.‚ and lived iuto Trajan’s reign,
which would make him seventy or eighty years old at the con·
demnation of Marius Priscus—the one date we are able to fix

. with confidence iu the whole of Juvenal's life. He began to
write iu the last years of Nero, and probably had prepared
most of the materials which he finally placed in the First and
Eighth Satires, and the rough draughts of others, before he
published the little jeu d'esprit on the actor Paris. Perhaps
also it would follow that the comparative repose and elevation
of Satires rs—xrv. are due rather to the tranquillising influence
of the reigns of Vespasian and Titus than to the mellowing
influence of advancing years. Before nn. 84, he had poems
enough completed to be published, with the enlarged version
of Satire vri, now pointed against the favourite of Domitian,
who had just been sacrificed to the jealousy of his master.
In that year he was banished to Egypt, probably for six months,
aud there witnessed the savage outbreak of fanaticism which·
isrecorded in the Fisteenth Satire. He returned to Rome in-
a state of suppressed indignation against the tyrant who had,
appropriated a doubtful compliment to a fallen favourite as
afrefleetion on his own good govemment, while he had entirely
disregarded the decorous homage to himself, with which the
satire opens. ¹He was able to take a'full revenge after Domi-
tian's death, by the publication of the Fourth Satire in its
present form. The additions, ou this hypothesis, must be taken
aa a proof that, like Landor, Juvenal retained his energy as
