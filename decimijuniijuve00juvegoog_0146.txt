Ridebat curas, nec non et gandia vulgi,
Interdum et lacrimas, qu'um Fortunae ipse minaci
Mandaret laqueum, mediumqneostenderet unguem.
Ergo supervacua ant perniciosa petuntur,
Propter quae sas est genua incerare deorum.
Quosdam 'praecipitat subjecta potentia magnae
Invidiae 3 mergit longa atque insignis honorum
Pagina3 descendunt statuae restemque sequuntur.
Ipsas deinde rotas bigarum impacta securis
Caedit, et immeritis franguntur crura caballis.
Jam striduntyignes, jam follibus atque caminis
Ardet adoratum populo caput, et crepat ingens
