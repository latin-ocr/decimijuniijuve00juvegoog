112 D. JUNII JUVENAEIS

Ad quod lascivi ludebant ruris alumni.
Tales ergo cibi, qualis domus atque supellex.
Tunc rudis et Graias mirari nescius artes}

Omnia tunc quibus invideas si lividulus sis. 110
Templorum quoque majestas praesentior, et vox
Nocte fere media, mediamque audita per urbem,

Officium vatis peragentibus, his monuit nos.'
