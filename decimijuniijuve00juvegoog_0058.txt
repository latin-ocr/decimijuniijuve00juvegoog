imponam] May be future or
subjunctive. 1 prefer the latter.
“Am I never to replyi'’ ii so,
impune recitavm't, “Is he not to
be punished sor having recited?'’
Any way the passage shews the
very close affinity oi the future tense
to the subjunctive mood.

2 toties] It lasted so many re·
citatione-cordi, a stock character
in Valgius, Virgil, Juvenal, and
Martial. According to the Scholiast‚
he is spoken os as a contemporary
in Valgius's lost elegies.

gives the judgment of wholesale
acquirers of antiquity.

5'l'elephus] A king os Mysia
wounded by the spear oi Achilles
and healed by its rust. He ligured'
in a play os Euripides now lost
with a piquant display of ostenta·
tious poverty and fluent sophistry.
He and Orestes are subjects os tra·
gedy: the epics oi the day are cha-
racterized, sr. 6-12.

summi] As the margin (the
feminine is found also in Licinius,
Macer, Rabirius, and Vitruvius) at
