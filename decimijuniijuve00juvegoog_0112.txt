Nemo dabit regum, quanti subsellia constent 1
Et quae conducto pendent anabathra tigillo,
Quaeque reportandis posita est orchestra cathedris.

Ducimus et litus sterili versamus aratro.

Nam si discedaS, laqueo tenet ambitiosi

Consuetudo mali; tenet insanabile multos .
Scribendi cacoethes, et aegro in corde senescit. ¹
