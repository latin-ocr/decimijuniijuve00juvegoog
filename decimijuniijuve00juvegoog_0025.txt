xviii INTRODUCTION.

before breakfast the next morning. There are tempers to
which itis easier to put aside what has to be altered lor weeks,
which grow into months. As tempers vary and our knowledge
ol Juvenals is likely to remain imperfect, it is safest to re*
member the busy idleness in which a Roman gentleman passed
his lise at the capital, and the lazy leisure ol the country

the Marian democracy against the imperial system, as we trace
in Tacitus the'protest of the expiring aristocracy os Sulla, rather
than ol the effete oligarchy ol Scaurus: like Sulla, Tacitus
desired that the Senate should be an open corporation rather
than a close one ; like Sulla, he believed that the Senate ought
to be in a position to govem the Roman Empire; unlike Sulla,
