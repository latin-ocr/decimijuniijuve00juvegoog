INTRODUCTI'ON. ’ xxvii

embrace the vast and complex interests of the Roman world:
this conviction had helped to reconcile those who were not
personally interested in the success ol Julius or Octavian to the
necessity of seeing the control of the world deputed to a single
governor. But though the centralised administration justified
their confidence by its superior efficiency, though at the end of
the first century much had been acoomplished both in the
interest of the govemment and of the govemed, the task was
immense, and it may be doubted whether the govemment os
Diocletian had overtaken its immensity3 it is certain that the
govemment of Domitian had not. There were still multitudes
oi questions which were decided by the courts or by the senate
almost without interserence from the prime, and within this
extensive though diminishing arena it was still possible for
politicians to win an intluence that was almost independent of
the favour of the emperor. It was possible sor an individual to
confer so many obligations that men shrank from voting against
his opinion in the senate and against his clients in the courts: .
though this did not protect him from the necessity of giving in
his adhesion to each successive govemment, it made it worth
the while of every successive govemment to defer to him on
condition that he should give it his hearty support. It may be
doubted whether any govemment which disposed of so much
patronage as the early emperors was so unfettered by routine in
selecting the objects of its favour: even Nero had not a court,
Domitian had hardly favourites, and a share of this patronage
was within the reach of any citizen who could make it worth
the emperor's while to court him. Nor was this all: a Vibius
Crispus ora Marcellus Eprius (Tac. de Oratoribus, vm. 3) could
extend the influence to which he owed the friendship of Caesar
by an ostentation of that friendship: men shrank from offend-
ing the intimate of the Palace‚ is they did not shrink from
disobliging a man who had obliged them, or their colleagues
whom he had obliged. All this together made up the position
which Tacitus and his contemporaries designate by the compre·
hensive term potentat. And potentrb was not to be had i .
