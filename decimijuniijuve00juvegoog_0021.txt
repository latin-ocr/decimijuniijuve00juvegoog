<xiv >INTRODUCTION.

and that Juvenal was indulging in a rather ilat mystification,
when he introduced an imaginary Mentor to warn him ol the
danger of denouncing Tigellinus, and propitiates his phantom
monitor by a promise only to attack the dead. Foris Tigel-
linus is merely the disguise of another reigning favourite, it
would be necessary to prove, in the first place, that Trajan ·
had a favourite who had power to persecute ; and impossible

Further on, at v. 193, the author speaks of his contemporaries
as selling themselves to the stage and the arena, without a
Nero to compel them; and at v. 221, we are informed that
the musical taste's oi Nero were the worst atrocity which called
for the righteous vengeance os Vindex and Galba. Of course

and they explain the ambiguity ol v. 198, where citharaedo
