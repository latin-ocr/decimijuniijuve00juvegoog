INTRODUCTION. xxxvii

buoyaut realism asserts itself at the end of two of the severest
Satires, by a sort of tribute to the coarse, robust, healthy ani-
malism of the average centurion, who is alive without the law,
and can venture to ask whether it is worth while to miss one’s
breakfast to be like Arcesilas and the musty Solous of the
Porch, and even to bid for a hundred starveling Greeks ata
penny a piece; though Persius is firmly convinced all the while
that nothing but the teaching of those despised Greeks can
save his fashionable contemporaries from the bondage of,
fererish desire, and the ruinous consciousness of growing degra-
dation. Nor is Persius less humorous when he refuses to sell
his private laugh, mere nothing as it is, for Labeo’s Iliad, or any

that it was 'his ambition to found upon Horace a style of
reater finish and condensation3 and he corrected himself
into obscurity in the attempt His knowledge of life was
exceedingly limited, and hence he is constautly enforcing
monotonous commonplaces by borrowed illustrations, in which
there is nothing fresh, except the shy youthful fervour of the
dutiful boy-for he remained a boy to the last, though he was
nearly thirty before he died on the Riviera—who describes
himself as petulanti splene cachinno, and yet repeats the morose
formulae which he had learnt from Cornutus, just as poor
Maurice de Guerin repeated the austere ultramontanism of De
Lamennais. Still, this single elemeut of interest, combined
with the literary honesty which kept Persius from writing any
thing which was not apart of his permanent consciousness,
makes him improve upon every reading, which is more than·
can be said of Juvenal, who writes as if he thought and felt
