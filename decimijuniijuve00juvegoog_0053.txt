Our instances shall be taken from the Seventh Satire: on
v. 2 we have the note Camenas. lucentibus poetis—where the
lecturer must have meant to explain tristes, while the scholar
took down the least important part of the heading. In the
same way in v. 7, Clio heads the following note-id est osti-
arius uel eustos atrienses. Here the explanation is so curtailed
as to be grammatically incomplete ; but this might be due to
a wish for brevity. When, however, we see that the pupil
has only taken down the last word of the clause (migraret
in utria Clio), which the lecturer recalled for comment, we
are inclined to set down the mutilated form of the note to
the hurry of dictation. Here is a stronger instance of the
same kind, from the note on v. 83: “Promisitque D. Τ.- Leton
Ideo quau libenter audiebat. Est enim et ipsud poema delectabile
et isse dicitur bonam vocem habuisse,” when the annotator
obviously did not know whether the lecturer was explain·
ing laetam or tonte dulcedine captos, and accordingly tried to
put down both.

Rather higher up we have a confusion of another kind on
v. 73, Pignerot Atreus. fenerator. iel est, qui Atreum scribit et ut
sumptus habeat res suns pignori dat· where the first part of the
note isa perverse explanation of the single word Atreus, and
the second a perfectly correct paraphrase on the whole line.

ι On v. 80 we read, Marmoreis et Serrano. Nomina sunt poe-

turum pauperum. At Serrano vos fietile in quo At. Serranus
solebat munducare. Saleio ut mendico. Cotilurn fictilem in quo
eu quaesnlsn sunt apponuntur. This note embodies both the
forms of confusion which arise respectively from inaccuracy
, in taking down the masters words, and from mixing up two
distinct explanations. Valla’s quotation frorn Probus throws
some light on the source of the latter ambiguity. llhmina
fuisse portarurn Probus putat, alii “sarrloenoJ' ut idern ait, et
“saluo'' uaso acceptent fictilia,- junioras uero “salino’' legunt et
“sarrana'’ ut, per uos in quo sol componitur, quaeque uilissima
intellegamus. The same satire supplies a fair crop of mere
clerical errors, such as would asise from a careless attempt to
