vi PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.

was right in more than one passage, especially on
questions of punctuation where in the first instance 1
had followed Mayor. Wherever the text was simply
a matter of manuscript authority,l have been glad to
givetJahrrs without discussion3 where the various read-
ings affected the sense or had a character of their own,
it seemed better to choose for myself and to give my .
reasonszssthere is always something irritating about an
edition which indicates a variety of reading without
giving a clueto the editor's principle os selection. , ,
Α Juvenal is a writer in whom every attentive reader
may hope to discover something fresh, while every.
Ι reader whose vigilance has not been chastened into
sagacity must expect sometimes to discover more than
is there; but in dealing with Juvenal it is safest to err
on the side¹ of excess. ln a highly literary age artificial
connexions‘and eti'ects occur more readily than natural;
a writer ‚can hardly employ an expression which does
not imply a train os half-forgotten thought. The
chronology of Juvenal's life and writings suggested in
the Introduction, which has been materially expanded,
isos course very precarious3 but it seems to rest upon
facts which have still to find their place in a really¹
adequate conception of his system of satirical· allusion. ,

Three satires have been altogether omitted as not

required in University Examinations, which proceed on‘
Δ the creditable hypothesis that all candidates sor a pass
or honours either possess or cultivate the temper to
which suchreading¹ is as painsul as it ought to be. ‘
