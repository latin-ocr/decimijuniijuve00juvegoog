count upon receiving the legacies which might be lest thern,
when Caesar administered to the estate ol every man who had
ever been heard to say that Caesar would be his heir. We
are lest to form our opinion of the rapacity of the imperial
govemment from a good deal os general declamation and from
one‘or two specific instances, doubtless taken from extreme
cases. It is probable that the material loss was ‚not what the
Romans chased at most 3 both Roman commoners and Roman
nobles when they spolre of liberty meant what they said: the
sense os having a master was sar more galling to them than the

expected, the more durable obstacle ol the two. Juvenal railed
heartily against tortoiseshell sosas while Tacitus complacently
bewailed the impossibility of suppressing luxury. In general it
may be said that Juvenal is one of the satirists who endeavour
to combat vice by consecrating prejudice. He is of the family ’
of Aristophanes and Moliere, notos Lucian and Erasmus, of
Rabelais and Voltaire. It may be reckoned either as his merit¹
