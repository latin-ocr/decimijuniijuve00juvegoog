viii INTRODUCTION.

ing the imputation of conferring military commands at the
suggestion of an actor, 'especially when the actor’s influence
bad been removed3 nor would his resentment be lessened if
Juvenal had deliberately republished‚ with an application to
his own reign, what had been originally directed against the
earlier Paris, the favourite of Nero. A wider question suggests
itself here. Did Juvenal· begin to writer under Nero, and to
publish under Domitian, while the revised edition of his works
was interrupted by death, perhaps in Trajan’s reign?

· That some such revised edition was attempted is probable,
from the statement of one old biographer, that a considerable
interval elapsed between the original composition of the lines
on Paris, and their reappearance in the Seventh Satire; from
the remark of another, that he enlarged (ampliavit) his satires
in exile; and from the curious circumstance that there are
MSS. in which the Sixteenth Satire, a mere fragment is placed
before the Fifteenth. Obviously, copyists must have changed ¹
' the order which Juvenal intended, in order that all the satires
might appear to be finished, except the last ; perhaps also
those who doubted the genuineness of the fragment may have
g wished to propagate their suspicions by relegating it to a sort
of Appendix. If Juvenal was in the habit of retouching his
compositions, it is obviously unsafe to infer the date of a satire
from single lines3 for in such a laboured style innumerable
' additions and insertions would be possible, which would im-
prove the brilliancy of the general effect, without impairing its
unity. Hence we cannot burld much upon the following list
of passages. ι ¹

In 1. 47, vnn 120, Juvenal mentions the exile and rapacity
of Marius Priscus, who was condemned for oppression m pro-
consular Africa, an. roo, which is the latest date that we can
fix with certainty. ἵ

In vr. 502, there ¹is an allusion to the successive layers of
curls, which cannot be traced on the imperial busts, our only
authority, higher than the¹ reign of Trajan3 but (ib. 385J3a
