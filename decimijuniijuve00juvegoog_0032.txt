ure'directed at least as much against the heartlessness aud the
ruffianly insolence of the great as against the defective police ol
Rome or the snobbish appetites of the diner out, or against the
smooth servility of foreigners We seem to trace in Juvenal
vestiges ol another grievance which afflicted Romanos rerum
dominos gentemque togatam as soon as Claudius and Nero had
decided that the empire should be cosmopolitan. Not only did
it become possible for foreigners to succeed almost as well as

the world Yet both Tacitus and Juvenal owe much to Stoi-
cism: the laste ior sonorous morality was sufficiently strong in

conclusione as could be separated from its premisses. To
Tacitus Stoicism commended itself as the system which Helvi·
