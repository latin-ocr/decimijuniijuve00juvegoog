nal was well to do he was all the fitter to represent the griev-
ances os the gregarious idlers who loitered away dreamy days
between the baths and the forum, and scarcely ever felt life
worth living except while the excitement of the circus roused
them sor a moment from their apathetic unrest

In reading Tacitus we are never allowed for an instant to
escape from the impression that the tyranny os the imperial
govemment was the crying evil os the age and the parent os all
the rest 3 in the letters of Pliny (though he represents perhaps a
later period than Juvenal) we see something of the bright side

profligacy which he had exceeded. They might quote the
austere Tacitus and the complaisant Martial in support os their
homage to their favourite3 but he made no impression whatever
on the sturdy puritanism os Juvenal. The third and fisth satires
