INTRODUCTION. xxxiii·

et Rome. It is hardly probable that actors¹ were deprived·
of their civil rights till the time of the Punic wara. The
severity of Roman manners did not reach its highest point
until the new aristocracy had become sufficiently powerful 'to'
lmpose its family traditions upon public opinion. Possibly if
Juvenal had gone far enough back in his search for the good·
old times he would have escaped from much of his Puritanism·
But it is an extenuation of his narrowness that the incapacity
for understanding that accomplishments from driving upwards·
could be practised with simplicity and decomm, for grace or
for pleasure‚ not for parade, was not only his defect but the
defect of all Roman society. But though the conditions of
the society in which he lives may condemn a writer to choose
between two unsatisfactory standards, it does not follow that

the cleamess of his personal insight. All fervour on such sub·¹

make a reputation by his poetry: it is said that Lady Byron
expected her husband as a part of his reformation to leave off Β
his ‘silly habit of writing verses' In Spain the nobles took a
pride in their dexterity in bull-fights‚ and a Roman noble
required at least as much skill to succeed as a bestiarius. We
should be shoclred ourselves if a member of our aristocracy
were to sing in public except for a charity 3 but we should see
no objection to his rowing in a public racc, or belonging to a
four-in-hand clnb, while to an American, the field-sports, on
which we pride ourselves, appear as barbarous as boxing.
Fervour on these subjects has other disadvantages beside
the certainty of becoming grotesque when it comes before an
andience of another period and another race. It effectually
excludes geniality. Plautus shares the fundamental concep-
tion of Juvenal, that life ought to be in the main a round of « '
