well as‘his malice late ς’ for lie must have been ne'arly 'seventy,
and may have been nearly eighty when Domitian :rhed His
own death, if he began to write in middle life under Nero,
must: be placed early in Trajan’s reign, aud this would
account for the remarkable absence of all distinct allusion
to..Trajan's victories, which would have been quite in place
in ¹the Eighth Satire, or in the Fourteenth, where, on
the contrary, he implies (v. 193) that frontier hostilities of
the most paltry kind afford the* only chance of military dis-
tinction. Nor is it likely that he undertook any fresh satire
under Trajan, except perhaps the Sixteenth, which would suit
very well with a time when a little military insolence was the
’ most serious evil which a satirist with failing powers could
select for attaclc If the fragment be the prologue to a satire
on military corruption and maladministration, its date would
naturally be carried back to the time of Domitian’s effortsto
ingratiate himself with the soldiery, which began with the
German campaign, 84 Α n.

From this sketch' rt appears that Juvenal must have been
from five and· twenty to thirty years in writing sixteen satires,
one a fragment3 and the difficulty rs not greatly diminished
ifwe take the second Junius and Fonteius; for even then
his literary activity must be made to extend from the death
of Domitian to at least 120 nn. Nor can we assume that
Juvenal wrote slowly because he wrote in a laboured style ;
for Statius, whose style is far more laboured, has left it on
record that he finished poems as long as most of Juvenal’s
satires in two or three days. Of course it is possible'to find
a reason for many delays in the evidence, external and in-
ternal, that Juvenal’s satires passed through much in the way
of revision and expansion. Maternus (Tac. de Orat 111. 2, 3)
could recite a tragedy on Cato one day, and the next sit down

to consider how many of Cato’s tirades or epigrams (it is dis·
tressing not to know which) should be transferred to Thyestes;
but Maternus was almost asexceptional as Southey, who finished
one epic over night and wrote a hundred lines >of another
